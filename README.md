This directory contains code written in R for all analyses reported in

R. Kyle Bocinsky, Johnathan Rush, Keith W. Kintigh, and Timothy A. Kohler
*Exploration and Exploitation in the Macrohistory of the Prehispanic Pueblo Southwest*

####Data file S1

There are three primary files:

Bocinsky_ET_AL_2015_PRISM_EXTRACTOR ~ a tool for extracting a study area from the 800-m LT81 PRISM dataset, and calculating annually-resolved climate summaries

Bocinsky_ET_AL_2015_PaleoCAR ~ a tool for running the PaleoCAR paleoclimate reconstruction method

Bocinsky_ET_AL_2015_ANALYSIS ~ the primary script analyzing the output and generating all statistics and figures discussed in the paper and Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Each script contains instructions for setting up a working directory. THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS CHANGE THE WORKING DIRECTORY IN EACH SCRIPT TO THE ACCOMPANYING DIRECTORY, "R".

WARNING: Running all of this will take a long time and substantial computing resources. You should do it anyway, though, to replicate our results and tweak our parameters to your specifications.
